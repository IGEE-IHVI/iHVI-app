## iHVI User Manual

The data input buttons are on the second row, including LST, NDVI, NDBI, Population Density, Population over 65 years old, Population less than 4 years old, Population Needs Care, Education Level, and Income Level. By default, the “|” below these buttons is “X”, indicating that the input data is empty.

The heat exposure index, heat sensitivity index, and adaptive capability index can be calculated when the correspondingly coloured input data has been filled in. If all the data is uploaded, users can click the blue buttons to calculate the heat vulnerability index and heat vulnerability score. 
The output destination is the same directory as the one where the iHVI desktop application is located. Users can define a different output folder by clicking on the “Select folder” button in the bottom right corner. If any errors occur during the calculation, the app will prompt the user with a warning and the user can make changes accordingly.
